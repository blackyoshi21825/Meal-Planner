# Meal-Planner
A simple meal planner. You can select the amount of fiber, protein, calories, sugar, fat, and vitamin & you would want in your meal, and it will output a list of meals, including the ingredients in grams. There will be badges on each meal, showing what type of meal and what cuisine it is from. You can create an account and also save meals to come back to later.

--DISCLAIMER--
This project is still in the early stages, and bugs will be present. Don't hesitate to reach out to my email to give me any things that I should fix or that I could add to this code. Thanks!
